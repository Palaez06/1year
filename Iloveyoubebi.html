            <p id="p1">Hi bebiii, itâ€™s been a year na pala noh? Itâ€™s already been a year since that night nung ginulo mo ko. 
                When you asked me what are we? Iâ€™m not complaining naman, it has been a very bright year for me with you by my side. So donâ€™t worry. 
                I canâ€™t believe that itâ€™s already been a year. I didnâ€™t think you had the patience to last up to a year of keeping me a secret. Although 
                there was this one time that we got caught and thatâ€™s in the past na, move on na tayo oyyy. Bebiiii, I hope are problem gets solved, I hope 
                that soon you donâ€™t need to hide me anymore.
            </p>

            <p id="p2">Bebiii, I just want you to know that everything will be ok. We will get what is rightfully ours, 
                weâ€™ll get what we always wanted. Iâ€™m sorry you have to go through that, my love. I know we already talked about that 
                but really, you donâ€™t deserve it. However, mark my words, my love, weâ€™ll get through this. All of this, I swear.
            </p>

            <p id="p3">You have no idea how much I love you, how much Iâ€™m scared to lose you. I want to be with you, my love. I want to 
                have a family with you, I want to see you the first thing I wake up in the morning, and most importantly, I want to take 
                care of you. So donâ€™t feel bad whenever I worry about you. I want to worry about you. Cause I want to take care of you. I 
                donâ€™t care if it causes me sleep, I will catch a bullet for you, my love. I will take care of my siopao if itâ€™s the last 
                thing I do.
            </p>

            <p id="p4">On another note, I am also very grateful to have you. Iâ€™m so thankful for everything you do for me, my love. I grew up 
                thinking I didnâ€™t deserve anything in life, you know that. But then you came along and made my life even better. You gave me 
                so much and you want to give me the world. Tip lang, wag mo naman bonggahan, ako nahihiya sayo eh. Kidding aside, I will bawe 
                with all you did, just not now oki? You just wait.  Thank you for everything, my love. Please donâ€™t ever leave my side. 
                I love you so muchhhhhhhhhhh.
            </p>
